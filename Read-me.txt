Instructions [Add-On]:

-Before installing this mod, please download and install the Weapon Limit adjuster:-

https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/cweaponinfoblob-limit-adjuster



1. Place the "bv238" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\

2. With OpenIV, extract [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and edit this with Notepad++. Add the following entry:
		<Item>dlcpacks:\bv238\</Item>

3. Now you are done, you will need a trainer with "spawn by name" function (Enhanced Native Trainer for example) to spawn the vehicle type in:

"bv238"


Tuning:
This aircraft has basic airplane customization (Engine, handling, flares and chaff)



If you're game crashes on startup, download a custom gameconfig.xml for your update.rpf. Example: https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-5-gameconfig-300-cars

I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
